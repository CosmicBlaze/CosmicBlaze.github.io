										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>My name is Alejandro Araque, and while it may not be the most interesting information, here's the basic bio we're all guilty of writing at some point. I study at Miami University and I'm working towards a degree in Creative Writing, having taken multiple literature classes where I have been able to study all types of written work as well as having the pleasure of experiencing multiple workshop classes where I have practiced and refined my skills. I'm hoping to one day become a published author for multiple fiction novels using my experiences at college.</p>
									<p>Throughout my life, I've moved to many different places such as Texas, Norway, Britain, and Puerto Rico, and travelled to many more on vacations with my family. I consider myself extremely lucky to have had these experiences as they have not only given me a wider worldview, but served as a basis for many of my creative ideas, inspiration which I'm sure you'll see within this project. I hope to infuse as many things from my own life into my stories as I can in order to reach as wide an audience as possible. I find that encountering something relatable in writing can make a story more valuable and remarkable to the reader, a feeling I deeply enjoy in my own reading that I hope to share with my readers.</p>
									<p>As a writer and prospective author, I like to work in the realm of fiction, specifically fantasy. I've been a pretty stereotypical "nerd" most of my life, finding enjoyment in video games and worlds that are considered impossible, so I've had exposure to all sorts of fascinating ideas. I'd love to create something that can capture as many people's interest just like the franchises that caught mine and be remembered as a great writer and, more significantly, an engaging creator of entire worlds.</p>

									<h2>The Staterra Project</h2>
									<p>In the early Spring of 2019, my high school friends and I had gathered in the physics classroom to meet up for Dungeons and Dragons club. It was the first meeting of the semester and we were thinking of starting something new and fresh, but no one had come prepared with anything in particular. We decided to try something new, and we all collaborated, offering ideas and random thoughts that we'd weave together with the guidance of the teacher running the club. Mindmaps became bulleted lists, sketches became rough maps, and ideas became Staterra, an entire (rough) world to use as our playground for short adventures and campaign concepts. However, with the arrival of COVID, the files we had started to refine quickly gathered dust as we focused on just getting through the school year.</p>
									<p>While my friends may have kept Staterra as a memory, I continued to tinker. I started re-writing old characters of mine with the foundations of Staterra at play, giving them interlinked and consistently organized backstories. I started tweaking details of what we had put together in order to increase the scope of the world and the way it interacted with itself. When bored, I'd create short stories that take place in Staterra, whether they had any continuity or canon was unimportant. Eventually, I discovered my passion for writing and decided I'd revive this old idea among friends as a fully-fledged franchise. That's exactly what I'll do, and it all begins here.</p>

									<h2>The Goal</h2>
									<p>This site is a starting point for the future of Staterra. Not exactly a traditional portfolio, but not something entirely professional. At least, not yet. For now, this will serve as a collection or museum, maybe some kind of artifact as the first properly preserved features of the Staterra franchise. Here, I can give a quick overview of the characters I intend to write for and give a thorough background regarding the setting of my stories. In time, these descriptions may evolve, and I'll even include a collection of short stories that take place in Staterra as samples of what is to be expected.</p>
									<p>As I've said, my ultimate goal is to become a published author. The ideas I've had for Staterra have added up over the years, adapated as I've met new friends and sources of inspiration, and I hope to bring light to each idea the most I possibly can. It'll be a lot of work, but a constantly growing world is the most exciting kind of project to pursue. I hope to establish this as a running franchise and continue adding to it for many years to come, spanning vastly different arcs and storylines as the ideas continue to flow.</p>
